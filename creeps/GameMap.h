-- NOTES:
-- WYSIWYG game map for A* algo. Use 3D array for single level maps (stages), 
-- 4D array for up-down level maps. Each element can be any non-negative integer, 
-- representing different types of objects on the map. Applicable for any complex patterns.
-- *********************************************************
-- Deprecated, the game map will be loaded from map.csv file.
